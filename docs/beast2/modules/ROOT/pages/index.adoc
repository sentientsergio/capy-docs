= Boost.Beast2

Boost.Beast2 enables users to write high level clients and servers that communicate on networks using the HTTP/1 and WebSocket protocols. In practice, Beast2 uses Boost.Asio and this bundle of related Boost libraries which must be used together: Boost.Capy, Boost.Buffers, Boost.Http.Proto, and Boost.Websocket.Proto.

Each of these libraries addresses specific areas of development:
Boost.Capy — application framework components
Boost.Buffers — buffer abstractions and utilities
Boost.Http.Proto — HTTP protocol implementation (Sans-I/O)
Boost.Websocket.Proto — WebSocket protocol implementation (Sans-I/O)

Separating these components into distinct libraries improves modularity, testability, and reuse.

== What you get

* Asio-based accept/connect loops wired to Http.Proto and Websocket.Proto.
* Router and middleware model (declarative handlers: describe responses, don’t write directly to sockets).
* Static file serving helper.
* Works with and without exceptions; targets small builds (few templates, fast compile).

== Requirements

* C++11 or later.
* Boost (headers, Asio, system, throw_exception, assert).
* Works with `-fno-exceptions`; exceptions are optional.
* Link to Beast2 statically or dynamically; enable Brotli/Zlib if you want the optional codecs.

== Tested compilers

* gcc: 5 to 14 (except 8.0.1)
* clang: 3.9, 4 to 18
* msvc: 14.1 to 14.42
