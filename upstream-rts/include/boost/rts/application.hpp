/** A collection of type-erased parts and process state

    An object of this type holds a collection of type-erased parts,
    where each part undergoes two-phase initialization. First the part is
    constructed by calling @ref emplace. The @ref start function invokes
    `start()` on each part. When @ref stop is called, each part has its
    `stop()` member invoked. And when the application object is destroyed,
    all the parts are destroyed in reverse order of construction.
