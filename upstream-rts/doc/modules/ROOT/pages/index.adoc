= Boost.RunTimeServices

Boost.RunTimeServices (to be renamed Boost.Capy) is a small C++11 library for collecting optional runtime services, starting them in order, and stopping them safely. It is friendly to embedded targets (optional exceptions/RTTI) and aims to keep compile times low.

What it provides:

* Type-based service registry (`boost::rts::polystore`) with optional aliasing via `key_type`.
* Two-phase lifecycle management (`start`/`stop`) via `boost::rts::application`.
* Dependency injection helper (`boost::rts::invoke`) to wire services into callables.
* Compression helpers (brotli/zlib) when enabled.

Why use it:

* Works with and without exceptions or RTTI.
* Designed for small hosts: minimal templates, fast builds.
* Deterministic teardown (reverse construction order).

Next steps:

* New to Capy? Start with the xref:quickstart.adoc[Quickstart].
* Doing real work? See xref:guides/registering-services.adoc[Register and access services] and xref:guides/injection.adoc[Inject dependencies].
* Need deeper behavior details? See xref:concepts.adoc[Concepts and behaviors].
* API details live in the xref:reference:boost/rts.adoc[Reference].
